# Introduction

This is my humble attempt of providing a minimalist ABNT-compliant thesis class without bells and whistles. Although I don't like ABNT at all, their requirements are fairly easy to achieve with just a few lines of code. Don't expect much of this repository right now, as I am currently busy writing my own thesis. However, once I am done, I will publish my code, so other researchers can benefit from a very simple and straightforward approach to ABNT-compliant academic documents.

## Inspiration

I was heavily inspired by the awesome work of my good friend Youssef Alvarenga Cherem and his cool `abnt` package (you can check the package manual [directly on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/abnt) or through your current TeX distro by issuing `texdoc abnt`). Consider my class as a tribute to him, and a gentle poking at the average Brazilian user who is used to writing spaghetti code!

## No bells and whistles?

Yes. The class design follows the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (not related to the band, sorry). According to Wikpedia, the KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

If you are brave enough to use TeX and friends to write your thesis, you must learn how to do things the right way. If you want to learn, I highly suggest my friend Nicola Talbot's book, [Using LaTeX to Write a PhD Thesis](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/thesis/), available for free in her publishing imprint (HTML and PDF versions).

## The name

[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. However, my class name happened by pure coincidence (well, and some sort of guilty nerdy pleasure)! The `obiwankenobi` name stands for *Oh boy I want ABNT notably killed except non obstructive bibliographic injections*. Who would have guessed?
